Introduction
============

Another size-coding project in order to produce some, this time a bit more heavy,
live wallpaper for Android powered devices. Rendering isn't exactly resource
hoggy but given somewhat limited calculation power many devices have, it's
possible wallpaper doesn't run too well on some of the devices or consumes
rather much battery life. Unfortunately there isn't much I can do about it at
the moment.

Beyond this, screensaver should comply with regular expectations one could have for
any screensaver. Application icon and screensaver thumbnail share the same image for
size reasons (goal is to produce as tiny .apk file as possible). Not to forget while
making rendering as dynamic as possible - it comes along with the good news file
size tends to drop significantly. Without the need to worry about differently sized
screens as there ought to be pixel correct output always.

That said, hope you enjoy this tiny Stripes live wallpaper for Android devices.
